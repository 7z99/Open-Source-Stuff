# Open-Source-Stuff
An open-source script and place collection to be used in Roblox games. These are not exploits, they are for development

I will be updating this whenever I feel like it, and if I don't forget.
You are free to use these scripts in your own projects, modify them, and do whatever the hell you want EXCEPT re-sell them, which you are not allowed to do UNLESS you modify it majorly to work to your own accustomations, in which case you are allowed to re-sell these scripts.

# Q&A
**Q: Can I resell this?**

A: As stated in the description above, you are not allowed to re-sell these scripts in an unmodified state, unless you heavily modify these scripts to your liking, in which case you will be allowed to.

**Q: What do they do?**

A: You can read the file descriptions, or if the name is self explanatory then you can probably guess what they are

**Q: Did you use any external frameworks? Like Rojo?**

A: No

**Q: Do I need to give credit?**

A: It is much preferred, however it is not mandatory, after all this is something i am making free, I guess

**Q: Do I need to pay for these?**

A: Is that even a question it's literally on GitHub.

**Q: I bought these from someone else, did I get scammed?**

A: Yes
